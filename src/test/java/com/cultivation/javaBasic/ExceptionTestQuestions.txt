What is the knowledge point of the test? Where is the official document to the knowledge point?

Why the test failed at first?
The test failed because the array for comparing results is empty or the methods required are missing.

Why you corrected the test that way?
I corrected the test by manually inputting the expected value when doing the operations or by filling up the methods.

Do you have further questions on this knowledge point?
I have a blocker when doing tests for 
should_get_method_name_in_stack_frame()
should_customize_exception()
should_customize_exception_continued()
seems it cannot get the error message in the exception.
